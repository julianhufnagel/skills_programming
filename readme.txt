Weather Web Application
This Python program allows to retrieve current and future weather information.
The Web Application uses an API service from OpenWeatherMap.
This is an application to check the weather in every city around the world.
Therefore, the program takes a specific city as a user input.
Consequently, the aim of the application is to provide the user with important weather information for a specific city.
First, the output displayed is the current weather information.
Secondly, there is the possibility to retrieve a weather forecast for the next hours or days.
The weather forecast consists of plots with temperature and precipitation information.
If the user wishes to, further information about the wind forecast for the next hours or days can be displayed.
Furthermore, the user can choose the data to be illustrated in a heat map.

Usage
To properly use this application, it is necessary to run the weather_app.py script.
After having this done, the streamlit app can be opened with the command line "streamlit run weather_app.py".
This opens a new tab in your internet browser with our streamlit app.
Within the web app, there are several options to show current weather and several forecasts.
The location for which the weather should be shown can be entered via a text input box.

Contributing

The project shows a selection of possible features for a weather app. It can be extended by visualizations of further weather data, e.g. snow or precipitation in general or by choosing other time related units. Another possibility is to deliver various comparisons between several cities.
